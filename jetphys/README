A jet physics analysis package, originally developed by Mikko Voutilainen
at the CMS experiment at CERN: https://github.com/miquork/jetphys
Additions and further development performed by his student Hannu Siikonen.

The code is made to be run over CMS SMPJ jet tuples, described by
https://github.com/cms-smpj/SMPJ

In order to get this package working, read this README carefully and at
least skim through mk_runFullAnalysis.C. This file is a remnant of the
highly modular days of this analysis package. At the present it is typically
sufficient to run the steps only up to the output-2b phase. It is best
to run each run in data separately due to the possible differences between
datasets. The output-1 phase is the most time-consuming (hours), as
the 2a and 2b steps are finished in a couple of minutes. Thus, it is
recommended that at least the output-1 step is performed separately -
not by using runFullAnalysis. 

For plotting purposes there is the script drawFracs.C. This is operated by
mk_mcPlots.C and mk_generalPlots.C. These are designed for streamlining the process
of generating various plots with the same script. That is, different parameter
valuues, which have an effect on the mode of operation. All the plots require
only ouput-1 and output-2b files.

The recommended way is to run the program at the CERN lxplus machines. The
procedure is described in the separate file LXPLUS.

Step-by-step installation {

  To start using this package, first clone it from git
     git clone https://github.com/miquork/jetphys.git
     cd jetphys
  
  Then we need to check out some additional packages:
  
  * jet energy corrections (JEC) software from jecsys package in git:
    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/miquork/jecsys.git
    ln -s jecsys/CondFormats jetphys/
    cd jetphys
  
  * JEC text files from JECDatabase in github:
    https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/tarballs/Summer15_50nsV5.tar.gz
    [save this to CondFormats/JetMETObjects/data]
    cd CondFormats/JetMETObjects/data
    tar -xzf Summer15_50nsV5.tar.gz
    cd ../..
  
  
  * RooUnfold: (not indispensable currently)
    svn co https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/unfolding/RooUnfold/trunk RooUnfold
    cd RooUnfold; make; cd ..
  (see also: http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/~adye/software/unfold/RooUnfold.html )
  
  Copy data files, and add a symlink
  
  Then, gen.

IF ODD PROBLEMS ARE OCCURRING, CHECK THE PIECES OF CODE WITH A "HOX" MENTION.
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME.

TO FIND SOME OLD PIECES OF CODE NO LONGER IN USE, REFER TO THE GITHUB VERSION FROM
JAN 31 2017 OR BEFORE. A FORMAT OF '// REMOVED: "X"' IS IN USE FOR NOTABLE REMOVALS.

DO NOT RUN CMSSW TOGETHER WITH THIS SOFTWARE PACKAGE. THERE IS A STANDALONE VERSION
OF JET CORRECTIONS THAT IS USED BY THIS CODE. IT WILL THROW VERY ODD ERRORS IF THE
COMMAND 'cmsenv' HAS BEEN RUN, AS THE JET CORRECTIONS ARE TAKEN FROM CMSSW CODE.
