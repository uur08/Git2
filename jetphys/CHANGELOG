10.9.16 (Hannu)

 - ROOT6 tends to use very much memory with the scripts, so running on lxplus is encouraged
 - Cleaned up some 'delete's that are better handled by ROOT's over-zealous ownership system
 - Hunted down some small bugs produced between version-updates
 - Cleaned up the code here and there
 - On LXPLUS a run tends to end with a segfault, but this is only ROOT's own memory-handling after the program has been run

31.8.16. LXPLUS usage, cleaning up and modernization (Hannu)

fillHistos:
 - Centralized includes fillHistos.C -> fillHistos.h
 - Removed the (redundant) explicit branch declarations from fillHistos.h
 - Changed t4_EvtHdr__mEvent from UInt_t to Int
 - Added missing branches to PFJets (but these are not loaded)
 - Added an adaptive method for handling triggers: uninteresting triggers are denoted by a blank ("") or in the output by the letter "x"
 - LXPLUS running options:
   - Run everything in one run
   - Run piecewisely, hadd the results (be sure to change the filenames or locations!)
   - Run in batch; the files are parsed together using hadd
